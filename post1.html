    <p>Sorting algorithms are an essential part of computer science, widely used in data processing, database systems, and various real-time applications. This post explores key sorting methods with real-world analogies and their technical significance.</p>

    <h4>Merge Sort: Structured and Efficient Organization</h4>
    <p>Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that breaks down a list into smaller sublists, sorts them, and merges them back together. It is highly efficient for large datasets, providing a stable and consistent sorting process with a time complexity of <code>O(n log n)</code>.</p>

    <h4>Quick Sort: High-Speed Performance</h4>
    <p>Quick Sort selects a pivot and partitions the array into subarrays that are then sorted recursively. It offers excellent average-case performance and is widely used in systems where fast sorting is a priority. Its average time complexity is also <code>O(n log n)</code>, though the worst-case is <code>O(n^2)</code>.</p>

    <h4>Bubble Sort: Simple but Inefficient</h4>
    <p>Although Bubble Sort is conceptually simple, it is rarely used in production due to its high time complexity of <code>O(n^2)</code>. It is mostly used for educational purposes to demonstrate basic sorting principles.</p>

    <h4>Real-World Use Cases</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Search engines use optimized sorting algorithms to rank results based on relevance.</li>
      <li>Financial platforms apply sorting for transaction history and performance analytics.</li>
      <li>Operating systems use sorting in task scheduling and memory management.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>Sorting algorithms play a foundational role in efficient computing. Understanding their strengths and limitations helps developers select the right algorithm for each use case. Whether organizing data in memory or processing millions of records, sorting is a crucial component of optimized software performance.</p>
