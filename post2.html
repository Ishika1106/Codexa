    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a core technology for web development, enabling developers to create visually appealing and responsive user interfaces. While powerful, mastering CSS layout and responsiveness often requires a deep understanding of its foundational models and rendering behaviors.</p>

    <h4>Understanding the Box Model</h4>
    <p>The CSS box model is fundamental to layout design. Each element is a box consisting of content, padding, border, and margin. Proper spacing and alignment rely on knowing how these layers interact. Developers often debug layout shifts caused by unaccounted padding or collapsed margins.</p>

    <h4>Modern Layout Techniques: Flexbox and Grid</h4>
    <p>Flexbox and Grid have revolutionized CSS layout capabilities. Flexbox provides one-dimensional control over spacing and alignment, while Grid offers two-dimensional layout structuring ideal for complex interfaces. Learning when to use each system is key to writing clean, scalable CSS.</p>

    <h4>Responsive Design with Media Queries</h4>
    <p>To ensure compatibility across devices, media queries allow content to adapt based on screen size, resolution, and orientation. A mobile-first approach—starting with smaller screens and scaling up—is widely adopted for performance and accessibility.</p>

    <h4>Best Practices</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Use relative units (%, rem, vw/vh) for responsive scaling.</li>
      <li>Keep class names semantic and avoid excessive specificity.</li>
      <li>Minimize use of <code>!important</code> to maintain flexibility.</li>
      <li>Test across various screen sizes and browsers regularly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>CSS plays a pivotal role in modern web development. While it can be challenging, a structured understanding of layout mechanics and responsive design principles empowers developers to build elegant and accessible websites. With practice and attention to detail, mastering CSS becomes an achievable and valuable skill.</p>
